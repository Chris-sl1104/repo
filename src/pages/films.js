    synopsis: `Mr. Hiram Lodge (Alyy Khan) returned to Riverdale, and he planned to change the entire town by building new plazas and hotels. Mr. Lodge was a true-blue capitalist, and all he cared about was benefiting from the deal, even if it meant doing something that the residents didn't want. Mr. Lodge had a secret meeting with Mr. Dawson (Vinay Pathak), a member of the local council, and he told him the plans he had for Riverdale. Mr. Lodge's wife Hermione (Kamal Sidhu) proposed that the hotel that they were planning to build shouldn't be situated on the outskirts of the town. She wanted it to be located in the heart of the city, and she proposed that it should be built where the historic Green Park was located. Mr. Dawson knew that it was going to be an uphill battle for him, as destroying Green Park was not something that people would like. Since the time John Riverdale leased the land from King Sarna in 1914, children planted trees in Green Park every year. Riverdale was an Anglo-Indian community and most people stayed even after India gained its Independence. Green Park was deeply rooted in the town's tradition and history, but still, Dawson told Mr. Lodge that he would try his best to get the motion passed as the latter decided to fund his campaign for the election of the District Contractor.

    Dawson needed only 5 votes to pass the motion and give the tender to Mr. Lodge's company to build the hotel. He knew that, by hook or by crook, he would have to lure in the council members to do as they wanted. The residents were totally unaware of this plan to destroy a place that was no less than a local heritage. But before the construction of the hotel, Hiram had planned to make a plaza where Pam's salon, Suzie's flower shop, and Hal's bookshop were located. He contacted the owners of the place, who in turn gave notice to their tenants to close their shops or match the amount of rent that Mr. Lodge was going to pay. Veronica is Hiram's daughter and is best friends with Betty. Veronica gives a party at her house, inviting Archie, Jughead, Dilton, Reginald "Reggie" Mantle (Vedang Raina), Moose (Rudra Mahuvarkar), Midge (Santana Roach) and others. Archie doesn't like that Reggie treats Dilton like his man-servant. Reggie has a crush on Veronica, but she only has eyes for Archie. Ricky (Luke Kenny) is Reggie's father and is the editor of the local Gazette.

    Betty's (Khushi Kapoor) father, Hal Cooper (Satyajit Sharma), realized that he would have to shut down his bookshop as he didn't have the money to pay his landlord. Betty blamed her best friend Veronica (Suhana Khan) for it, though the latter had no clue that her father was planning to do something like that. Betty claims that Veronica's father does not care for the people of the town and says the same things for Veronica as well. Veronica went to her mother, and she made sure that Hal got a job in the new bookstore in town.

    This was the sort of relationship Veronica Lodge and Betty Cooper shared. Their common love interest was Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda), but the feelings they had for him never created a rift between them. After Veronica came back to Riverdale, Archie was confused, and he did something that he shouldn't have done. He double-dated Betty and Veronica for quite some time, though Jughead Jones (Mihir Ahuja) time and again told him that he shouldn't be doing that. Ethel (Aditi "Dot" Saigal) has a crush on Jughead who works at Pop Tate's as a waiter. Ethel warns Betty that Archie is two timing her, but she refuses to have any doubts on Archie and believes that he will change. Archie, Betty, and Veronica were on a mini vacation with their friends when Betty saw Archie and Veronica getting intimate with each other. This was also the vacation where Reggie admits that he knows that Dilton is in love with him.

    Just a few days ago, Betty had kissed Archie, and she believed that he, too, had feelings for her, but now, after seeing what he did, she didn't know whether he was just confused or toxic enough to cheat on both of them. Betty's problem was that no matter how angry she was with Archie, the moment he came and apologized to her, she couldn't help but leave behind all her anger and agree to whatever he said. Betty was smitten by him, but one day, she decided to tell Veronica the truth, as it was eating her up from within. The moment Veronica got to know that Archie had kissed Betty, she was furious, as she hadn't imagined that Archie could do something like that. The girls caught Jughead and forced him to tell them the entire truth. Jughead spilled the beans and told them how Archie dedicated a song to both of them and how he said that he loved them equally. Both the girls went to confront Archie and told him that he should immediately stop doing things that created a rift between them. They both asked him to just be their friend, as they valued their relationship way too much.

    From the very beginning, Archie wanted to go to London to study, and he knew that he wouldn't have any problems as his uncle Ben (Farhan Akhtar) was living here. Archie's parents, Fred (Suhaas Ahuja) and Mary (Tara Sharma), didn't like the fact that their son didn't want to stay back at Riverdale, but when they saw the kind of obsession he had for going abroad to pursue his studies, they, too, decided to let him do what he wanted. But then, very soon, the news that Mr. Hiram Lodge was going to destroy Green Park became known to the general public, and Archie had a change of heart. He felt as if he were abandoning his friends for his own selfish interests. Archie always believed that the grass was greener on the other side, but for the first time, he realized that it was greener at the place where it was watered. He felt that he owed a lot to Riverdale, and he couldn't leave the town to its fate when the time came. So, Archie took the hard decision to not go abroad and decided to stop the unsympathetic capitalists from destroying the park.

    Though the council had 5 votes in favor of building the hotel in the park, there was another hidden clause that could stop them, which Archie and his friends hadn't known about for a very long time. One of the council members who wasn't happy with the state of things told the kids that if they got some 4500-odd signatures from the residents opposing the construction of the hotel, then Mr. Lodge would have no option but to stop. Reggie writes an article against the council proposal, but Ricky refuses to print it since Hiram Lodge is the biggest advertiser in the Gazette newspaper and without that money, the paper would not survive. Reggie and Archie suspect Veronica of being the insider in their group who is revealing their strategy to Hiram Lodge. Veronica confronts her father, who says that his money is what pays for her lavish lifestyle. But Veronica says that her friends hate her because of his actions. Eventually the group figures out that it was Ricky's PA who was the insider and not Veronica.

    Mr. Dawson tried his best to prevent the teenagers from getting the signatures, but Archie and his friends were relentless. They went door to door, organized a fair on the park, used Dilton's (Yuvraj Menda) radio to spread the information, and did whatever they could to awaken the conscience of the people.

    The citizens of Riverdale voted against the construction, and Mr. Lodge had to inevitably stop. His own daughter was a part of the protest, and though he knew that he wouldn't be able to make as much profit as he had dreamed of, he was happy that he lost to his own daughter and that she had the determination to stand for what she believed in. It all ended well for Archie and his gang, and their conflict against the establishment made them learn some major life lessons. Not only did they save the environment and the natural habitat, which served as a home for so many species, but they also realized that not everything could be bought with money.`,

    name: "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes",

    background: planetofapesBG,
    synopsis: `Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father Koro after dropping Noa from a high platform.

Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. He buries Koro and sets out to rescue his clan. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement.

Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious "book" capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae strangles him to death.

The group enters the vault, finding a stockpile of weapons and Mae's "book", which is actually a satellite deciphering key. The apes discover children's picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Lightning, one of Proximus' lieutenants, threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found before triggering the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but manages to trap and drown him. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea.

As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to tensely bid farewell to Noa. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing its weapons because they were created by humans and thus should only be used by humans. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can co-exist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide.`,

    synopsis: `In a forest village in India, Kid lives with his mother Neela and is inspired by tales of Hanuman she teaches him. Baba Shakti, a ruthless spiritual guru in the nearby city of Yatana, sends Rana Singh, the corrupt police chief, to force out the villagers and acquire their land. The village is massacred, but Neela is able to hide Kid before Rana kills her and sets her body on fire. Kid's futile attempts to save her leave his hands terribly burned and scarred.

Years later, Kid earns a living in Yatana as a monkey-masked fighter at Tiger's Temple, an underground boxing club, where he is incentivised to lose. Kid intends to exact revenge on Baba, now an influential political figure, and Rana, who frequents Kings, a luxury brothel run by Queenie Kapoor. Kid obtains a job in the kitchen, where he uses the alias "Bobby" from a cleaning product and befriends Alphonso, a gangster working for Queenie. Kid helps Alphonso win a large bet on a bout at Tiger's Temple in exchange for promotion to a waiter to access the VIP floor.

Kid buys a gun and trains a stray dog to carry it past security. Kid serves Rana cocaine spiked with powdered bleach in order to confront and shoot him in the bathroom. The assassination attempt is spoiled and Kid fights his way out of the building. Fleeing in Alphonso's supercharged tuk-tuk, Kid crashes and gets arrested, but he escapes. The chase ends when Kid is shot by police, falling into a river. Kid is rescued by Alpha, the keeper of Ardhanarishvara, a local temple whose hijra community is being targeted by Baba's growing political movement.

Learning that he is now a wanted fugitive, Kid recovers at the temple. Alpha guides him through a hallucinogenic experience in which he tears open his chest and is able to confront the trauma of his mother's death. Now with a newfound purpose, Kid trains in combat with the hijra and begins to fight for the marginalized as well. When the hijra's sanctuary is threatened, Kid returns to fight at Tiger's Temple, placing a large bet on himself. He emerges victorious with enough money to save Alpha's temple. During Diwali, Baba's candidate is elected and their nationalist party celebrates at Kings. Kid bleaches his monkey mask white and fights his way inside with improvised weapons, joined by Alpha and her warriors.

Queenie attempts to shoot Kid, but is killed by Sita, one of the exploited prostitutes and Kid's co-worker. Using Queenie's severed thumb to access the penthouse, Kid confronts Rana and beats him to death in a fistfight. He reaches Baba, who wounds him with blades hidden in his padukas. Kid kills Baba using the same blades against him. Having finally avenged his mother's death, Kid collapses from his injuries, reminiscing about Neela and his devotion to Hanuman.`,
